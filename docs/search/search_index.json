Another supported solver is IBM ILOG CPLEX . To switch between solvers, use the solver constructor argument, as shown below. It is also possible to specify a time limit (in seconds) and a relative MIP gap tolerance. from miplearn import LearningSolver solver = LearningSolver(solver=\"cplex\", time_limit=300, gap_tolerance=1e-3) Selecting solver components LearningSolver is composed by a number of individual machine-learning components, each targeting a different part of the solution process. Each component can be individually enabled, disabled or customized. The following components are enabled by default: LazyConstraintComponent : Predicts which lazy constraint to initially enforce. ObjectiveValueComponent : Predicts the optimal value of the optimization problem, given the optimal solution to the LP relaxation. PrimalSolutionComponent : Predicts optimal values for binary decision variables. In heuristic mode, this component fixes the variables to their predicted values. In exact mode, the predicted values are provided to the solver as a (partial) MIP start. The following components are also available, but not enabled by default: BranchPriorityComponent : Predicts good branch priorities for decision variables. To create a LearningSolver with a specific set of components, the components constructor argument may be used, as the next example shows: # Create a solver without any components solver1 = LearningSolver(components=[]) # Create a solver with only two components solver2 = LearningSolver(components=[ LazyConstraintComponent(...), PrimalSolutionComponent(...), ]) It is also possible to add components to an existing solver using the solver.add method, as shown below. If the solver already holds another component of that type, the new component will replace the previous one. # Create solver with default components solver = LearningSolver() # Replace the default LazyConstraintComponent by one with custom parameters solver.add(LazyConstraintComponent(...)) Adjusting component aggressiveness The aggressiveness of classification components (such as PrimalSolutionComponent and LazyConstraintComponent ) can be adjusted through the threshold constructor argument. Internally, these components ask the ML models how confident they are on each prediction (through the predict_proba method in the sklearn API), and only take into account predictions which have probabilities above the threshold. Lowering a component's threshold increases its aggressiveness, while raising a component's threshold makes it more conservative. MIPLearn also includes MinPrecisionThreshold , a dynamic threshold which adjusts itself automatically during training to achieve a minimum desired true positive rate (also known as precision). The example below shows how to initialize a PrimalSolutionComponent which achieves 95% precision, possibly at the cost of a lower recall. To make the component more aggressive, this precision may be lowered. PrimalSolutionComponent(threshold=MinPrecisionThreshold(0.95)) Evaluating component performance MIPLearn allows solver components to be modified, trained and evaluated in isolation. In the following example, we build and fit PrimalSolutionComponent outside the solver, then evaluate its performance. from miplearn import PrimalSolutionComponent # User-provided set of previously-solved instances train_instances = [...] # Construct and fit component on a subset of training instances comp = PrimalSolutionComponent() comp.fit(train_instances[:100]) # Evaluate performance on an additional set of training instances ev = comp.evaluate(train_instances[100:150]) The method evaluate returns a dictionary with performance evaluation statistics for each training instance provided, and for each type of prediction the component makes.

In this page, we describe these problems, the included instance generators, and we present some benchmark results for LearningSolver with default parameters. Preliminaries Benchmark challenges When evaluating the performance of a conventional MIP solver, benchmark sets , such as MIPLIB and TSPLIB, are typically used. The performance of newly proposed solvers or solution techniques are typically measured as the average (or total) running time the solver takes to solve the entire benchmark set. For Learning-Enhanced MIP solvers, it is also necessary to specify what instances should the solver be trained on (the training instances ) before solving the actual set of instances we are interested in (the test instances ). If the training instances are very similar to the test instances, we would expect a Learning-Enhanced Solver to present stronger perfomance benefits. In MIPLearn, each optimization problem comes with a set of benchmark challenges , which specify how should the training and test instances be generated. The first challenges are typically easier, in the sense that training and test instances are very similar. Later challenges gradually make the sets more distinct, and therefore harder to learn from. Baseline results To illustrate the performance of LearningSolver , and to set a baseline for newly proposed techniques, we present in this page, for each benchmark challenge, a small set of computational results measuring the solution speed of the solver and the solution quality with default parameters. For more detailed computational studies, see references . We compare three solvers: baseline: Gurobi 9.0 with default settings (a conventional state-of-the-art MIP solver) ml-exact: LearningSolver with default settings, using Gurobi 9.0 as internal MIP solver ml-heuristic: Same as above, but with mode=\"heuristic\" All experiments presented here were performed on a Linux server (Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS) with Intel Xeon Gold 6230s (2 processors, 40 cores, 80 threads) and 256 GB RAM (DDR4, 2933 MHz). All solvers were restricted to use 4 threads, with no time limits, and 10 instances were solved simultaneously at a time. Maximum Weight Stable Set Problem Problem definition Given a simple undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and weights $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$, the problem is to find a stable set $S \\subseteq V$ that maximizes $ \\sum_{v \\in V} w_v$. We recall that a subset $S \\subseteq V$ is a stable set if no two vertices of $S$ are adjacent. This is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. Random instance generator The class MaxWeightStableSetGenerator can be used to generate random instances of this problem, with user-specified probability distributions. When the constructor parameter fix_graph=True is provided, one random Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph $G_{n,p}$ is generated during the constructor, where $n$ and $p$ are sampled from user-provided probability distributions n and p . To generate each instance, the generator independently samples each $w_v$ from the user-provided probability distribution w . When fix_graph=False , a new random graph is generated for each instance, while the remaining parameters are sampled in the same way. Challenge A Fixed random Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph $G_{n,p}$ with $n=200$ and $p=5\\%$ Random vertex weights $w_v \\sim U(100, 150)$ 500 training instances, 50 test instances MaxWeightStableSetGenerator(w=uniform(loc=100., scale=50.), n=randint(low=200, high=201), p=uniform(loc=0.05, scale=0.0), fix_graph=True) Traveling Salesman Problem Problem definition Given a list of cities and the distance between each pair of cities, the problem asks for the shortest route starting at the first city, visiting each other city exactly once, then returning to the first city. This problem is a generalization of the Hamiltonian path problem, one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. Random problem generator The class TravelingSalesmanGenerator can be used to generate random instances of this problem. Initially, the generator creates $n$ cities $(x_1,y_1),\\ldots,(x_n,y_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, where $n, x_i$ and $y_i$ are sampled independently from the provided probability distributions n , x and y . For each pair of cities $(i,j)$, the distance $d_{i,j}$ between them is set to: d_{i,j} = \\gamma_{i,j} \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2} where $\\gamma_{i,j}$ is sampled from the distribution gamma . If fix_cities=True is provided, the list of cities is kept the same for all generated instances. The $gamma$ values, and therefore also the distances, are still different. By default, all distances $d_{i,j}$ are rounded to the nearest integer. If round=False is provided, this rounding will be disabled. Challenge A Fixed list of 350 cities in the $[0, 1000]^2$ square $\\gamma_{i,j} \\sim U(0.95, 1.05)$ 500 training instances, 50 test instances TravelingSalesmanGenerator(x=uniform(loc=0.0, scale=1000.0), y=uniform(loc=0.0, scale=1000.0), n=randint(low=350, high=351), gamma=uniform(loc=0.95, scale=0.1), fix_cities=True, round=True, ) Multidimensional 0-1 Knapsack Problem Problem definition Given a set of $n$ items and $m$ types of resources (also called knapsacks ), the problem is to find a subset of items that maximizes profit without consuming more resources than it is available. More precisely, the problem is: \\begin{align*} \\text{maximize} & \\sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_j \\\\ \\text{subject to} & \\sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} x_j \\leq b_i & \\forall i=1,\\ldots,m \\\\ & x_j \\in \\{0,1\\} & \\forall j=1,\\ldots,n \\end{align*} Random instance generator The class MultiKnapsackGenerator can be used to generate random instances of this problem. The number of items $n$ and knapsacks $m$ are sampled from the user-provided probability distributions n and m . The weights $w_{ij}$ are sampled independently from the provided distribution w . The capacity of knapsack $i$ is set to b_i = \\alpha_i \\sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} where $\\alpha_i$, the tightness ratio, is sampled from the provided probability distribution alpha . To make the instances more challenging, the costs of the items are linearly correlated to their average weights. More specifically, the price of each item $j$ is set to: p_j = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{w_{ij}}{m} + K u_j, where $K$, the correlation coefficient, and $u_j$, the correlation multiplier, are sampled from the provided probability distributions K and u . If fix_w=True is provided, then $w_{ij}$ are kept the same in all generated instances. This also implies that $n$ and $m$ are kept fixed. Although the prices and capacities are derived from $w_{ij}$, as long as u and K are not constants, the generated instances will still not be completely identical. If a probability distribution w_jitter is provided, then item weights will be set to $w_{ij} \\gamma_{ij}$ where $\\gamma_{ij}$ is sampled from w_jitter . When combined with fix_w=True , this argument may be used to generate instances where the weight of each item is roughly the same, but not exactly identical, across all instances. The prices of the items and the capacities of the knapsacks will be calculated as above, but using these perturbed weights instead. By default, all generated prices, weights and capacities are rounded to the nearest integer number. If round=False is provided, this rounding will be disabled.

For this reason, both Python 3.6+ and Julia 1.3+ are required. A mixed-integer solver is also required, and its Python bindings must be properly installed. Supported solvers are CPLEX and Gurobi. Optimization problems currently need to be specified in the Pyomo modeling language. A JuMP interface to the package is currently under development. To install MIPLearn, run the following commands: git clone https://github.com/ANL-CEEESA/MIPLearn.git cd MIPLearn make install After installation, the package miplearn should become available to Python. It can be imported as follows: import miplearn Note To install MIPLearn in another Python environment, switch to that environment before running make install . To install the package in development mode, run make develop instead. Using LearningSolver The main class provided by this package is LearningSolver , a learning-enhanced MIP solver which uses information from previously solved instances to accelerate the solution of new instances. The following example shows its basic usage: from miplearn import LearningSolver # List of user-provided instances training_instances = [...] test_instances = [...] # Create solver solver = LearningSolver() # Solve all training instances for instance in training_instances: solver.solve(instance) # Learn from training instances solver.fit(training_instances) # Solve all test instances for instance in test_instances: solver.solve(instance) In this example, we have two lists of user-provided instances: training_instances and test_instances . We start by solving all training instances. Since there is no historical information available at this point, the instances will be processed from scratch, with no ML acceleration. After solving each instance, the solver stores within each instance object the optimal solution, the optimal objective value, and other information that can be used to accelerate future solves. After all training instances are solved, we call solver.fit(training_instances) . This instructs the solver to train all its internal machine-learning models based on the solutions of the (solved) trained instances. Subsequent calls to solver.solve(instance) will automatically use the trained Machine Learning models to accelerate the solution process. Describing problem instances Instances to be solved by LearningSolver must derive from the abstract class miplearn.Instance . The following three abstract methods must be implemented: instance.to_model() , which returns a concrete Pyomo model corresponding to the instance; instance.get_instance_features() , which returns a 1-dimensional Numpy array of (numerical) features describing the entire instance; instance.get_variable_features(var_name, index) , which returns a 1-dimensional array of (numerical) features describing a particular decision variable. The first method is used by LearningSolver to construct a concrete Pyomo model, which will be provided to the internal MIP solver. The second and third methods provide an encoding of the instance, which can be used by the ML models to make predictions. In the knapsack problem, for example, an implementation may decide to provide as instance features the average weights, average prices, number of items and the size of the knapsack. The weight and the price of each individual item could be provided as variable features. See src/python/miplearn/problems/knapsack.py for a concrete example. An optional method which can be implemented is instance.get_variable_category(var_name, index) , which returns a category (a string, an integer or any hashable type) for each decision variable. If two variables have the same category, LearningSolver will use the same internal ML model to predict the values of both variables. By default, all variables belong to the \"default\" category, and therefore only one ML model is used for all variables. If the returned category is None , ML predictors will ignore the variable. It is not necessary to have a one-to-one correspondence between features and problem instances. One important (and deliberate) limitation of MIPLearn, however, is that get_instance_features() must always return arrays of same length for all relevant instances of the problem. Similarly, get_variable_features(var_name, index) must also always return arrays of same length for all variables in each category. It is up to the user to decide how to encode variable-length characteristics of the problem into fixed-length vectors. In graph problems, for example, graph embeddings can be used to reduce the (variable-length) lists of nodes and edges into a fixed-length structure that still preserves some properties of the graph. Different instance encodings may have significant impact on performance. Obtaining heuristic solutions By default, LearningSolver uses Machine Learning to accelerate the MIP solution process, while maintaining all optimality guarantees provided by the MIP solver. In the default mode of operation, for example, predicted optimal solutions are used only as MIP starts. For more significant performance benefits, LearningSolver can also be configured to place additional trust in the Machine Learning predictors, by using the mode=\"heuristic\" constructor argument. When operating in this mode, if a ML model is statistically shown (through stratified k-fold cross validation ) to have exceptionally high accuracy, the solver may decide to restrict the search space based on its predictions. The parts of the solution which the ML models cannot predict accurately will still be explored using traditional (branch-and-bound) methods. For particular applications, this mode has been shown to quickly produce optimal or near-optimal solutions (see references and benchmark results ). Danger The heuristic mode provides no optimality guarantees, and therefore should only be used if the solver is first trained on a large and representative set of training instances. Training on a small or non-representative set of instances may produce low-quality solutions, or make the solver incorrectly classify new instances as infeasible. Saving and loading solver state After solving a large number of training instances, it may be desirable to save the current state of LearningSolver to disk, so that the solver can still use the acquired knowledge after the application restarts. This can be accomplished by using the standard pickle module, as the following example illustrates: from miplearn import LearningSolver import pickle # Solve training instances training_instances = [...] solver = LearningSolver() for instance in training_instances: solver.solve(instance) # Train machine-learning models solver.fit(training_instances) # Save trained solver to disk pickle.dump(solver, open(\"solver.pickle\", \"wb\")) # Application restarts... # Load trained solver from disk solver = pickle.load(open(\"solver.pickle\", \"rb\")) # Solve additional instances test_instances = [...] for instance in test_instances: solver.solve(instance) Solving training instances in parallel In many situations, training and test instances can be solved in parallel to accelerate the training process. LearningSolver provides the method parallel_solve(instances) to easily achieve this: from miplearn import LearningSolver training_instances = [...] solver = LearningSolver() solver.parallel_solve(training_instances, n_jobs=4) solver.fit(training_instances) # Test phase... test_instances = [...] solver.parallel_solve(test_instances) Current Limitations Only binary and continuous decision variables are currently supported.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#installation","text":"MIPLearn is mainly written in Python, with some components written in Julia.
