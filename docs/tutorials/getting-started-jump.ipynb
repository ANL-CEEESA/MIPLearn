More specifically, assume that the company owns $n$ generators, denoted by $g_1, \\ldots, g_n$. Each generator can either be online or offline. An online generator $g_i$ can produce between $p^\\text{min}_i$ to $p^\\text{max}_i$ megawatts of power, and it costs the company $c^\\text{fix}_i + c^\\text{var}_i y_i$, where $y_i$ is the amount of power produced. An offline generator produces nothing and costs nothing. The total amount of power to be produced needs to be exactly equal to the total demand $d$ (in megawatts).\n",
