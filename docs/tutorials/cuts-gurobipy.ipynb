    "# User cuts and lazy constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "User cuts and lazy constraints are two advanced mixed-integer programming techniques that can accelerate solver performance. User cuts are additional constraints, derived from the constraints already in the model, that can tighten the feasible region and eliminate fractional solutions, thus reducing the size of the branch-and-bound tree. Lazy constraints, on the other hand, are constraints that are potentially part of the problem formulation but are omitted from the initial model to reduce its size; these constraints are added to the formulation only once the solver finds a solution that violates them. While both techniques have been successful, significant computational effort may still be required to generate strong user cuts and to identify violated lazy constraints, which can reduce their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "MIPLearn is able to predict which user cuts and which lazy constraints to enforce at the beginning of the optimization process, using machine learning. In this tutorial, we will use the framework to predict subtour elimination constraints for the **traveling salesman problem** using Gurobipy. We assume that MIPLearn has already been correctly installed.\n",

    "User cuts and lazy constraints are also supported in the Python/Pyomo and Julia/JuMP versions of the package. See the source code of <code>build_tsp_model_pyomo</code> and <code>build_tsp_model_jump</code> for more details. Note, however, the following limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python/Pyomo: Only `gurobi_persistent` is currently supported. PRs implementing callbacks for other persistent solvers are welcome.\n",
    "- Julia/JuMP: Only solvers supporting solver-independent callbacks are supported. As of JuMP 1.19, this includes Gurobi, CPLEX, XPRESS, SCIP and GLPK. Note that HiGHS and Cbc are not supported. As newer versions of JuMP implement further callback support, MIPLearn should become automatically compatible with these solvers.\n",

Unlike a regular lazy constraint solver callback, note that `lazy_separate` does not add the violated constraints to the model; it simply returns a list of objects that uniquely identifies the set of lazy constraints that should be generated. Enforcing the constraints is the responsbility of the second callback function, `lazy_enforce`. This function takes as input the model and the list of violations found by `lazy_separate`, converts them into actual constraints, and adds them to the model through `m.add_constr`.\n",
