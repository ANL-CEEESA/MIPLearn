    "In the previous page, we introduced *training data collectors*, which solve the optimization problem and collect raw training data, such as the optimal solution. In this page, we introduce **feature extractors**, which take the raw training data, stored in HDF5 files, and extract relevant information in order to train a machine learning model."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction is an important step of the process of building a machine learning model because it helps to reduce the complexity of the data and convert it into a format that is more easily processed. Previous research has proposed converting absolute variable coefficients, for example, into relative values which are invariant  to various transformations, such as problem scaling, making them more amenable to learning. Various other transformations have also been described.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the framework, we treat data collection and feature extraction as two separate steps to accelerate the model development cycle. Specifically, collectors are typically time-consuming, as they often need to solve the problem to optimality, and therefore focus on collecting and storing all data that may or may not be relevant, in its raw format. Feature extractors, on the other hand, focus entirely on filtering the data and improving its representation, and are therefore much faster to run. Experimenting with new data representations, therefore, can be done without resolving the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MIPLearn, extractors implement the abstract class [FeatureExtractor][FeatureExtractor], which has methods that take as input an [H5File][H5File] and produce either: (i) instance features, which describe the entire instances; (ii) variable features, which describe a particular decision variables; or (iii) constraint features, which describe a particular constraint. The extractor is free to implement only a subset of these methods, if it is known that it will not be used with a machine learning component that requires the other types of features.\n",

    "[H5FieldsExtractor][H5FieldsExtractor], the most simple extractor in MIPLearn, simple extracts data that is already available in the HDF5 file, assembles it into a matrix and returns it as-is. The fields used to build instance, variable and constraint features are user-specified. The class also performs checks to ensure that the shapes of the returned matrices make sense."

    "Alvarez, Louveaux and Wehenkel (2017) proposed a set features to describe a particular decision variable in a given node of the branch-and-bound tree, and applied it to the problem of mimicking strong branching decisions. The class [AlvLouWeh2017Extractor][] implements a subset of these features (40 out of 64), which are available outside of the branch-and-bound tree. Some features are derived from the static defintion of the problem (i.e. from objective function and constraint data), while some features are derived from the solution to the LP relaxation. The features have been designed to be: (i) independent of the size of the problem; (ii) invariant with respect to irrelevant problem transformations, such as row and column permutation; and (iii) independent of the scale of the problem. We refer to the paper for a more complete description.\n",
