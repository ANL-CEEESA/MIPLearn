The problem we discuss below is a simplification of the **unit commitment problem,** a practical optimization problem solved daily by electric grid operators around the world. \n",

    "Suppose that you work at a utility company, and that it is your job to decide which electrical generators should be online at a certain hour of the day, as well as how much power should each generator produce. More specifically, assume that your company owns $n$ generators, denoted by $g_1, \\ldots, g_n$. Each generator can either be online or offline. An online generator $g_i$ can produce between $p^\\text{min}_i$ to $p^\\text{max}_i$ megawatts of power, and it costs your company $c^\\text{fix}_i + c^\\text{var}_i y_i$, where $y_i$ is the amount of power produced. An offline generator produces nothing and costs nothing. You also know that the total amount of power to be produced needs to be exactly equal to the total demand $d$ (in megawatts). To minimize the costs to your company, which generators should be online, and how much power should they produce?\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple problem can be modeled as a *mixed-integer linear optimization* problem as follows. For each generator $g_i$, let $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be a decision variable indicating whether $g_i$ is online, and let $y_i \\geq 0$ be a decision variable indicating how much power does $g_i$ produce. The problem is then given by:\n",
