    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmark sets such as [MIPLIB](https://miplib.zib.de/) or [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) are usually employed to evaluate the performance of conventional MIP solvers. Two shortcomings, unfortunately, make existing benchmark sets less than ideal for evaluating the performance of learning-enhanced MIP solvers: (i) while existing benchmark sets typically contain hundreds or thousands of instances, machine learning (ML) methods typically benefit from having orders of magnitude more instances available for training; (ii) current machine learning methods typically provide best performance on sets of homogeneous instances, buch general-purpose benchmark sets contain relatively few examples of each problem type.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this challenge, MIPLearn provides random instance generators for a wide variety of classical optimization problems, covering applications from different fields, that can be used to evaluate new learning-enhanced MIP techniques in a measurable and reproducible way. As of MIPLearn 0.3, nine problem generators are available, each customizable with user-provided probability distribution and flexible parameters. The generators can be configured, for example, to produce large sets of very similar instances of same size, where only the objective function changes, or more diverse sets of instances, with various sizes and characteristics, belonging to a particular problem class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we describe the problems included in the library, their MIP formulation and the generation algorithm."

The MPS files for these problems contain only the constraints that were generated during a trial run, not the entire set of constraints. Resolving the MPS file, therefore, may not generate a feasible primal solution for the problem.\n",

    "## Bin Packing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bin packing** is a combinatorial optimization problem that asks for the optimal way to pack a given set of items into a finite number of containers (or bins) of fixed capacity. More specifically, the problem is to assign indivisible items of different sizes to identical bins, while minimizing the number of bins used. The problem is NP-hard and has many practical applications, including logistics and warehouse management, where it is used to determine how to best store and transport goods using a limited amount of space."

    "The **capacitated p-median** problem is a variation of the classic $p$-median problem, in which a set of customers must be served by a set of facilities. In the capacitated $p$-Median problem, each facility has a fixed capacity, and the goal is to minimize the total cost of serving the customers while ensuring that the capacity of each facility is not exceeded. Variations of problem are often used in logistics and supply chain management to determine the most efficient locations for warehouses or distribution centers."

    "## Unit Commitment\n",
    "\n",
    "The **unit commitment problem** is a mixed-integer optimization problem which asks which power generation units should be turned on and off, at what time, and at what capacity, in order to meet the demand for electricity generation at the lowest cost. Numerous operational constraints are typically enforced, such as *ramping constraints*, which prevent generation units from changing power output levels too quickly from one time step to the next, and *minimum-up* and *minimum-down* constraints, which prevent units from switching on and off too frequently. The unit commitment problem is widely used in power systems planning and operations."

In this formulation, we assume linear production costs. For each generator $g$ and time $t$, let $x_{gt}$ be a binary variable which equals one if unit $g$ is on at time $t$, let $w_{gt}$ be a binary variable which equals one if unit $g$ switches from being off at time $t-1$ to being on at time $t$, and let $p_{gt}$ be a continuous variable which indicates the amount of power generated.

    "### Random instance generator\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `UnitCommitmentGenerator` can be used to generate random instances of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the user-provided probability distributions `n_units` and `n_periods` are sampled to determine the number of generating units and the number of time steps, respectively. Then, for each unit, the probabilities `max_power` and `min_power` are sampled to determine the unit's maximum and minimum power output. To make it easier to generate valid ranges, `min_power` is not specified as the absolute power level in MW, but rather as a multiplier of `max_power`; for example, if `max_power` samples to 100 and `min_power` samples to 0.5, then the unit's power range is set to `[50,100]`. Then, the distributions `cost_startup`, `cost_prod` and `cost_fixed` are sampled to determine the unit's startup, variable and fixed costs, while the distributions `min_uptime` and `min_downtime` are sampled to determine its minimum up/down-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "After parameters for the units have been generated, the class then generates a periodic demand curve, with a peak every 12 time steps, in the range $(0.4C, 0.8C)$, where $C$ is the sum of all units' maximum power output. Finally, all costs and demand values are perturbed by random scaling factors independently sampled from the distributions `cost_jitter` and `demand_jitter`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `fix_units=True`, then the list of generators (with their respective parameters) is kept the same for all generated instances. If `cost_jitter` and `demand_jitter` are provided, the instances will still have slightly different costs and demands."
