class RelaxationComponent(Component):
    """
    A Component that tries to build a relaxation that is simultaneously strong and easy
    to solve. Currently, this component is composed by three steps:

    - RelaxIntegralityStep
    - DropRedundantInequalitiesStep
    - ConvertTightIneqsIntoEqsStep

    Parameters
    ----------
    redundant_classifier : Classifier, optional
        Classifier used to predict if a constraint is likely redundant. One deep
        copy of this classifier is made for each constraint category.
    redundant_threshold : float, optional
        If the probability that a constraint is redundant exceeds this threshold, the
        constraint is dropped from the linear relaxation.
    tight_classifier : Classifier, optional
        Classifier used to predict if a constraint is likely to be tight. One deep
        copy of this classifier is made for each constraint category.
    tight_threshold : float, optional
        If the probability that a constraint is tight exceeds this threshold, the
        constraint is converted into an equality constraint.
    slack_tolerance : float, optional
        If a constraint has slack greater than this threshold, then the constraint is
        considered loose. By default, this threshold equals a small positive number to
        compensate for numerical issues.
    check_feasibility : bool, optional
        If true, after the problem is solved, the component verifies that all dropped
        constraints are still satisfied, re-adds the violated ones and resolves the
        problem. This loop continues until either no violations are found, or a maximum
        number of iterations is reached.
    violation_tolerance : float, optional
        If `check_dropped` is true, a constraint is considered satisfied during the
        check if its violation is smaller than this tolerance.
    max_check_iterations : int
        If `check_dropped` is true, set the maximum number of iterations in the lazy
        constraint loop.
