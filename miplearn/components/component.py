        Method called by LearningSolver at the end of each iteration.

        After solving the MIP, LearningSolver calls `iteration_cb` of each component,
        giving them a chance to modify the problem and resolve it before the solution
        process ends. For example, the lazy constraint component uses `iteration_cb`
        to check that all lazy constraints are satisfied.

        If `iteration_cb` returns False for all components, the solution process
        ends. If it retunrs True for any component, the MIP is solved again.
