        There is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between models and

        generate the complete model. Features may also be statistics computed from

        may decide to provide as instance features only the average weights, average
        prices, number of items and the size of the knapsack.

        violation, LearningSolver will then call the build_lazy_constraint, add the
        generated Pyomo constraint to the model, then resolve the problem. The
        process repeats until no further lazy constraint violations are found.

        Each "violation" is simply a string, a tuple or any other hashable type which
        allows the instance to identify unambiguously which lazy constraint should be
        generated. In the Traveling Salesman Problem, for example, a subtour
