class MultiKnapsackGenerator:
    """Random instance generator for the multi-dimensional knapsack problem.

    Instances have a random number of items (or variables) and a random number of
    knapsacks (or constraints), as specified by the provided probability
    distributions `n` and `m`, respectively. The weight of each item `i` on knapsack
    `j` is sampled independently from the provided distribution `w`. The capacity of
    knapsack `j` is set to ``alpha_j * sum(w[i,j] for i in range(n))``,
    where `alpha_j`, the tightness ratio, is sampled from the provided probability
    distribution `alpha`.

    To make the instances more challenging, the costs of the items are linearly
    correlated to their average weights. More specifically, the weight of each item
    `i` is set to ``sum(w[i,j]/m for j in range(m)) + K * u_i``, where `K`,
    the correlation coefficient, and `u_i`, the correlation multiplier, are sampled
    from the provided probability distributions. Note that `K` is only sample once
    for the entire instance.

    If `fix_w=True`, then `weights[i,j]` are kept the same in all generated
    instances. This also implies that n and m are kept fixed. Although the prices and
    capacities are derived from `weights[i,j]`, as long as `u` and `K` are not
    constants, the generated instances will still not be completely identical.

    If a probability distribution `w_jitter` is provided, then item weights will be
    set to ``w[i,j] * gamma[i,j]`` where `gamma[i,j]` is sampled from `w_jitter`.
    When combined with `fix_w=True`, this argument may be used to generate instances
    where the weight of each item is roughly the same, but not exactly identical,
    across all instances. The prices of the items and the capacities of the knapsacks
    will be calculated as above, but using these perturbed weights instead.

    By default, all generated prices, weights and capacities are rounded to the
    nearest integer number. If `round=False` is provided, this rounding will be
    disabled.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n: rv_discrete
        Probability distribution for the number of items (or variables).
    m: rv_discrete
        Probability distribution for the number of knapsacks (or constraints).
    w: rv_continuous
        Probability distribution for the item weights.
    K: rv_continuous
        Probability distribution for the profit correlation coefficient.
    u: rv_continuous
        Probability distribution for the profit multiplier.
    alpha: rv_continuous
        Probability distribution for the tightness ratio.
    fix_w: boolean
        If true, weights are kept the same (minus the noise from w_jitter) in all
        instances.
    w_jitter: rv_continuous
        Probability distribution for random noise added to the weights.
    round: boolean
        If true, all prices, weights and capacities are rounded to the nearest
        integer.
