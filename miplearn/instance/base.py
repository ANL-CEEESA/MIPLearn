    In the knapsack problem, for example, this class could hold the number of items,
    their weights and costs, as well as the size of the knapsack. Objects
    implementing this class are able to convert themselves into a concrete
    optimization model, which can be optimized by a solver, or into arrays of

        The array is used by LearningSolver to determine how similar two instances
        are. It may also be used to predict, in combination with variable-specific
        features, the values of binary decision variables in the problem.

        There is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between models and
        instance features: the features may encode only part of the data necessary to
        generate the complete model. Features may also be statistics computed from
        the original data. For example, in the knapsack problem, an implementation
        may decide to provide as instance features only the average weights, average
        prices, number of items and the size of the knapsack.

        The returned array MUST have the same length for all relevant instances of
        the problem. If two instances map into arrays of different lengths,

        decision variable before the optimization takes place. In the knapsack
        problem, for example, an implementation could provide as variable features
        the weight and the price of a specific item.

        Returns lazy constraint violations found for the current solution.

        After solving a model, LearningSolver will ask the instance to identify which
        lazy constraints are violated by the current solution. For each identified
        violation, LearningSolver will then call the build_lazy_constraint, add the
        generated Pyomo constraint to the model, then resolve the problem. The
        process repeats until no further lazy constraint violations are found.

        Each "violation" is simply a string, a tuple or any other hashable type which
        allows the instance to identify unambiguously which lazy constraint should be
        generated. In the Traveling Salesman Problem, for example, a subtour
        violation could be a frozen set containing the cities in the subtour.

        decide to proactively build some lazy constraints at the beginning of the

        build_lazy_constraints will be called without a corresponding call to
        find_violated_lazy_constraints.

        The implementation should not directly add the constraint to the model. The
