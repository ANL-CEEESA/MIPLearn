        Parameters
        ----------
        iteration_cb: IterationCallback
            By default, InternalSolver makes a single call to the native `solve`
            method and returns the result. If an iteration callback is provided
            instead, InternalSolver enters a loop, where `solve` and `iteration_cb`
            are called alternatively. To stop the loop, `iteration_cb` should return
            False. Any other result causes the solver to loop again.
        lazy_cb: LazyCallback
            This function is called whenever the solver finds a new candidate
            solution and can be used to add lazy constraints to the model. Only the
            following operations within the callback are allowed:
                - Querying the value of a variable
                - Querying if a constraint is satisfied
                - Adding a new constraint to the problem
            Additional operations may be allowed by specific subclasses.
        user_cut_cb: UserCutCallback
            This function is called whenever the solver found a new integer-infeasible
            solution and needs to generate cutting planes to cut it off.
        tee: bool
            If true, prints the solver log to the screen.
