class LearningSolver:
    """
    Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MIP) solver that extracts information
    from previous runs and uses Machine Learning methods to accelerate the
    solution of new (yet unseen) instances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    components: [Component]
        Set of components in the solver. By default, includes:
            - ObjectiveValueComponent
            - PrimalSolutionComponent
            - DynamicLazyConstraintsComponent
            - UserCutsComponent
    mode: str
        If "exact", solves problem to optimality, keeping all optimality
        guarantees provided by the MIP solver. If "heuristic", uses machine
        learning more aggressively, and may return suboptimal solutions.
    solver: Callable[[], InternalSolver]
        A callable that constructs the internal solver. If None is provided,
        use GurobiPyomoSolver.
    use_lazy_cb: bool
        If true, use native solver callbacks for enforcing lazy constraints,
        instead of a simple loop. May not be supported by all solvers.
    solve_lp_first: bool
        If true, solve LP relaxation first, then solve original MILP. This
        option should be activated if the LP relaxation is not very
        expensive to solve and if it provides good hints for the integer
        solution.
    simulate_perfect: bool
        If true, each call to solve actually performs three actions: solve
        the original problem, train the ML models on the data that was just
        collected, and solve the problem again. This is useful for evaluating
        the theoretical performance of perfect ML models.

        Solves the given instance. If trained machine-learning models are
        available, they will be used to accelerate the solution process.

        The argument `instance` may be either an Instance object or a
        filename pointing to a pickled Instance object.

        This method adds a new training sample to `instance.training_sample`.
        If a filename is provided, then the file is modified in-place. That is,
        the original file is overwritten.

        If `solver.solve_lp_first` is False, the properties lp_solution and
        lp_value will be set to dummy values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance: miplearn.Instance or str
            The instance to be solved, or a filename.
        model: pyomo.core.ConcreteModel
            The corresponding Pyomo model. If not provided, it will be created.
        output: str or None
            If instance is a filename and output is provided, write the modified
            instance to this file, instead of replacing the original file. If
            output is None, discard modified instance.
        tee: bool

            "Sense", "Log", "Warm start value" and "LP value".

            Additional components may generate additional keys. For example,
            ObjectiveValueComponent adds the keys "Predicted LB" and
            "Predicted UB". See the documentation of each component for more
            details.
