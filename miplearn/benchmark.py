class BenchmarkRunner:
    """
    Utility class that simplifies the task of comparing the performance of different
    solvers.

    Example
    -------
    ```python
    benchmark = BenchmarkRunner({
        "Baseline": LearningSolver(...),
        "Strategy A": LearningSolver(...),
        "Strategy B": LearningSolver(...),

    benchmark.parallel_solve(test_instances, n_jobs=5)
    benchmark.save_results("result.csv")
    ```

    Parameters
    ----------
    solvers: Dict[str, LearningSolver]
        Dictionary containing the solvers to compare. Solvers may have different
        arguments and components. The key should be the name of the solver. It
        appears in the exported tables of results.
