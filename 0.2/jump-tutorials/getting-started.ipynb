More specifically, assume that your company owns $n$ generators, denoted by $g_1, \\ldots, g_n$. Each generator can either be online or offline. An online generator $g_i$ can produce between $p^\\text{min}_i$ to $p^\\text{max}_i$ megawatts of power, and it costs your company $c^\\text{fixed}_i + c^\\text{var}_i y_i$, where $y_i$ is the amount of power produced. An offline generator produces nothing, and costs nothing. You also know that the total amount of power to be produced needs to be exactly equal to the total demand $d$ (in megawatts). To minimize the costs to your company, which generators should be online, and how much power should they produce?\n",

For each generator $g_i$, let $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be a decision variable indicating whether $g_i$ is online, and let $y_i \\geq 0$ be a decision variable indicating how much power does $g_i$ produce.

    "The log above is quite complicated if you have never seen it before, but the important line in the one starting with `feasible solution found [...] objective value 1.705169e+07`. This line indicates that MIPLearn was able to construct a warm start with value `1.705169e+07`. Using this warm start, SCIP then proceeded with the branch-and-cut process to either prove its optimality or find an even better solution. Very quickly, however, SCIP proved that the solution produced by MIPLearn was indeed optimal and terminated. It was able to do this without generating a single cutting plane or running any other heuristics; it could tell the optimality by the root LP relaxation alone, which was very fast. \n",
